# 06 — Backend API Layer (FastAPI)

**Project:** Ketabdaneh
**Document status:** Implementation artifact — first business endpoint established; the API surface is intentionally minimal and grows task by task.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-09
**Depends on:** [01-ARCHITECTURE.md](01-ARCHITECTURE.md) (communication boundary), [04-BACKEND-PERSISTENCE.md](04-BACKEND-PERSISTENCE.md) (session foundation), [05-DATABASE-MIGRATIONS.md](05-DATABASE-MIGRATIONS.md) (seed data)

---

## 1. Purpose

Document the backend HTTP layer and the **pattern every future endpoint
follows**. This layer is deliberately thin: per docs/01 §3.2, the backend owns
the domain, but business logic lives in domain code — routers translate HTTP,
they do not decide rules.

The established pattern:

```
HTTP route (app/api/<resource>.py)
        ↓
API schema (app/schemas/<resource>.py)   — the HTTP/JSON contract
        ↓
service / domain logic  — only when a route is more than a trivial query
        ↓
SQLAlchemy persistence (app/models, via the get_db session dependency)
        ↓
response model (same API schema) → JSON
```

## 2. Structure

```
apps/api/app/
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── roles.py        # one router module per resource
├── schemas/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── role.py         # RoleRead — request/response models for roles
└── main.py             # FastAPI app: include_router() + /api/health
```

## 3. Conventions

1. **All business routes live under `/api`** (matching `/api/health`).
   A router declares `APIRouter(prefix="/api", tags=["<resource>"])` and is
   included from `app/main.py`.
2. **Schemas are the only HTTP contract.** Pydantic models in
   `app/schemas/` shape input and output; ORM models never leak through.
   Read models use `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` so ORM rows serialize
   directly, and expose only confirmed business fields — audit columns
   (`created_at`/`updated_at`) are not returned unless a requirement asks
   for them.
3. **Every database route takes `Session = Depends(get_db)`** (docs/04 §4).
   The session is closed by the dependency, including on error.
4. **Service layer only when justified.** `GET /api/roles` is a single
   ordered query — the router issues it directly. The moment an endpoint
   carries real logic (validation beyond types, multi-step changes,
   cross-module coordination), that logic moves into a service/domain
   function the router calls. Wrapping every trivial query "for symmetry"
   is over-engineering, not architecture.
5. **Deterministic ordering** on list endpoints (roles are ordered by
   `code`) — stable responses make testing and diffing reliable.
6. **No business rules are invented here.** If a route needs a rule that is
   TBD (docs/00 §7), the route waits; the API follows the domain decisions,
   never the other way around.

## 4. Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | Liveness check | No database involved; works without `DATABASE_URL` |
| GET | `/api/roles` | List the permanent organizational roles (reference data, seeded by migration `0002`) | Read-only; ordered by `code`; returns `[{id, code, name}]` |

Roles are **read-only by design**: the six rows are migration-owned reference
data (docs/05 §5a). No create/update/delete endpoints exist for them —
changing the confirmed role set is a schema-level (migration) decision, not a
runtime operation.

## 5. Tests

`tests/test_api_roles.py` exercises the full HTTP stack — routing, dependency
injection, response serialization — with FastAPI's `TestClient`, overriding
`get_db` with the shared in-memory SQLite session (conftest.py uses
`StaticPool` + `check_same_thread=False` because TestClient runs the app in a
worker thread). PostgreSQL behavior is verified by running the application
against the real database (§6).

## 6. Validation (development)

From `apps/api` (venv active, PostgreSQL running):

```bash
python -m pytest                 # all tests, including API tests (SQLite)
python -m app.db.check           # real database connectivity
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000 # then: GET /api/health, GET /api/roles
```

## 7. Out of Scope (unchanged TBDs)

- **Authentication/authorization** — TBD-A13/A11; no route requires identity
  yet. When auth lands, it will be enforced inside this layer (docs/01 §4).
- Write endpoints for roles (see §4), persons/events/assignments APIs,
  pagination and error-format conventions (docs/01 §4 TBDs T4/T5).
- OpenAPI → TypeScript type generation for the frontend (TBD T3).
